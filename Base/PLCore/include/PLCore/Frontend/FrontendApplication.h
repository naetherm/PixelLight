/**
*  @brief
*    Frontend application class
*
*  @remarks
*    As the name of this class indicates, this is the base class for applications running
*    within a frontend (the application host). The main loop as well as other logic is handed
*    over to a host in order to become passive. Although a frontend application is always
*    running within a frontend, it shouldn't care about the frontend. Just write our application
*    as if there wouldn't be any "outer world". By following this philosophy as close as possible
*    and only accessing frontend features when really necessary, you enhance the chance that your
*    application can be embedded within other applications like browsers such as MS Internet Explorer
*    or Mozilla Firefox without problems.
